# Kolacik Session Log

## 2026-01-08 - Initial Setup

### What We Did
- Forked Strudel from codeberg.org/uzu/strudel
- Created kolacik theme (near-black background, Operator Mono font, orange keywords, teal strings)
- Built live sync system: Claude can push code to browser via playground.strudel
- Started learning Strudel basics

### Live Sync Architecture
- `sync-server.mjs` - WebSocket server on port 4322, watches playground.strudel
- `website/src/repl/sync.mjs` - client that connects and syncs with editor
- Modified `useReplContext.jsx` to hook into sync

### Files Created
- `playground.strudel` - live code scratchpad
- `sync-server.mjs` - sync server
- `claude.md` - teaching instructions
- `what_jura_knows.md` - knowledge state
- `plan.md` - learning plan
- `packages/codemirror/themes/kolacik.mjs` - custom theme

### Jura's Progress
- Learned: euclidean rhythms, polymetric, struct, off vs delay, wet/dry
- Next: scales, notes, .add(), more pattern modifiers

### To Start Dev
```bash
pnpm dev
node sync-server.mjs &
# open localhost:4321
```
