# Jura's Strudel Knowledge State

## Actually Knows (used it, gets it)

### Pattern Basics
- `s("bd hh sd hh")` - sequencing samples
- `*4` - repeat
- `[a b]` - subdivision
- `<a b c>` - alternate per cycle
- `~` - rest

### Just Learned Today
- `a(3,8)` - euclidean rhythm
- `{a b c}%2` - polymetric
- `.struct("x ~ x")` - rhythmic gate
- `.off(time, fn)` - pattern copy with offset + transform
- `.jux(fn)` - stereo split trick
- `.delay()` / `.delaytime()` / `.delayfeedback()` - echo effect
- wet/dry concept

### Understands Conceptually (hasn't really used)
- `.lpf()` / `.hpf()` - knows it's filtering
- `sine.range().slow()` - LFO modulation
- `.sometimes()` / `.rarely()` - probability
- `a|b` - random choice
- `a?` - probability
- `.iter()` - rotating pattern
- `.pan()` - stereo

## Doesn't Know Yet
- `.add()` - note arithmetic
- Scales, notes, any of that
- Chords
- Most effects beyond basic filter/delay
- Most pattern modifiers

## Music Theory
- **None.** Zero. Nada.
- Doesn't know what a chord is
- Doesn't know what scales are for
- Plays guitar as a beginner (might help with some intuition)

## Learning Style
- Signal processing background helps with effects
- Needs visualizations
- Learns by poking at live code
- Direct, no hand-holding
